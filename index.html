            <p>My current approach involves casting the result as {[K in T[number]]: K} where T is an alias for typeof arr, but this approach doesn't give me any auto-completion.What do I write to get TypeScript to do show me this stuff?</p>

            <p>I have no idea about page area (see 10.1 number 3), because I haven't had these experiences! I think paged media is this, this and print function in browser.</p>
